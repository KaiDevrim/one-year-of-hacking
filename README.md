# One Year of Hacking with Hack Club

Forked from [@cytronicoder](https://github.com/cytronicoder/one-year-of-hacking)

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm [Kai](https://devrim.tech) and I'm a 17 year old student developer in California. I've built [a](https://github.com/KaiDevrim/XKCD.Net) [lot](https://github.com/devrimtech/devrim.tech) [of](https://github.com/KaiDevrim/Reproductive) [things](https://github.com/KaiDevrim/StarItAllWeb) in the past year, but I've never really documented my journey, what I've learned, and what I've built. So, I'm going to do that here.

This is a collection of all the things I've (or will!) learn and build in the next year. I'll be updating this README every week with what I've learned and what I've built. I'll also be posting updates on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devrimkai) and on my [Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/kaidevrim).

## Why?

I've been coding for a while now, but I've never really documented my journey. I've always wanted to, but I've never really gotten around to it. I've also never really documented what I've learned, and what I've built. Through this, I hope to inspire others to start getting into tech like I did, and partially to get myself the motivation to keep going.

## So, what are you going to do?

tl;dr: I'm going to learn to code, and build a bunch of things.

I really got myself in competitive programming, and I want to learn more about it over the next year along with a ton of C#. I'm also going to make my first [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com) game.

Additionally, I'm going to be learning a lot of other things, including:

- **Low-Level Development** (I have a lot of saved guides and books on making my own Operating System and Compiler that I want to try to tackle at some point.)
- **Data structures and algorithms** (I want to do at least one LeetCode problem a week, but want to try and achieve one LeetCode problem a day. I will be using a collection of books and guides I have saved to learn.)
- **Hardware** (I really want to build a custom macropad/stream deck, and also help build a microphone.)
- **Blogging** (I want to make at least one blog post a month, hopefully a lot more.)
- And a lot more!

## What will you do when 2024 comes around?

Well, I might do this whole cycle again! I'll probably take some time reflecting on what I did this year, but it is very likely that this repository becomes (sort of) a diary for me. We will see! ðŸ¤”
