## ðŸ¤— Hugging Face course

I going to be working on the [Hugging Face course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1) over the next few days to gain a solid introduction to NLP and transformers. Code snippets will be in this repository - either in a Markdown file or in a Jupyter notebook.

### Notes on chapter 1: Introduction to NLP

- NLP is basically machines trying to understand human language
  - Context matters a lot when it comes to classifying text or generating what's next
  - Applicable in both text and speech
    - We work with NLP in computer vision as well when it comes to describing images
- Common NLP tasks
  - Classifying sentences/words in a sentence
  - Generating text
  - Extracting information from text
  - Generating new text from existing text
- Why NLP is so challenging
  - Machines only understand binary, whereas humans understand a lot more
  - Need to find a way to represent language in a way that machines can understand and process
