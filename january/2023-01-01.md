## ü•ß Setting up PiKVM

I recently started upgrading my server and needed a way of remotely troubleshooting my server if anything goes wrong. I have always had an issue where I needed to unplug my server and plug it into my keyboard and monitor if I ever needed to fix a hard drive or networking issue with it. With this PiKVM I am able to, from anywhere in the world, use a keyboard, mouse, and even video, and also turn off and on my server at will. I purchased the PiKVM kit from Geekworm off of Amazon. I just had to do some screwing in of parts to get it to work. Now, I just have to plug it into the ATX ports on my new motherboard, which I will do once I get back from Las Vegas.

## üêâ ZFS vs. Unraid

I also started looking at which type of RAID setup I need out of my server. ZFS has the advantage that it is much faster and has a lot more community support and features. Unraid on the other hand is something I have already bought and also works with my other various hard drives lying around. I will probably end up using Unraid as it is the simplest solution for me, and I can install some ZFS support on it.
