## Server is finished

Cleaned up my server, installed TrueNAS Scale on it and everything is nice and ready for the software deployments!!! I also spent a good chunk of the day just cleaning up my room, getting ready for classes tomorrow, and just a lot of other somewhat fun stuff. Too bad it is raining so I cannot walk the dog, but that just means more time working on my server, and other projects. Also my brother is leaving to University tomorrow morning so my awesome Christmas break is coming to a complete halt. I am planning on making a to-do list for the entire year as well as a month to month to-do list. I want to make sure that this year is the best year yet.
